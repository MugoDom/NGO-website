                        needed to thrive within society. Enrolment figures only tell part of the story. Around 250 million 5-to-12 year olds cannot read or write, whether they are in school or not. Education transforms children’s lives by helping them
                        overcome poverty. This leads to better health and increased income opportunities. Without it, many children remain trapped in a life of poverty and hardship.

                        benefits of sending their children to school are outweighed by the immediate need to send them to work or keep them at home to help with chores. Children miss out on school because their families need them to earn money. But by
                        sacrificing their education, they become trapped in a cycle of poverty.

                        of learning is evident. Across the world, 200 million young people leave school without the skills they need to thrive, plus an estimated 775 million adults – 64 percent of whom are women – who lack the most basic reading and writing
                        skills. 4</p>
